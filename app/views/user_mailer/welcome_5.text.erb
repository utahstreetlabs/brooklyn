<%= word_wrap %Q[Hi #{raw @user.firstname},

Why shop online alone when you can bring your friends along? Invite your friends to Copious. They won't even have to chip in for gas.

Sharing listings on Facebook and Twitter allows friends to weigh in on your purchase decisions before you've pulled the trigger. Solicit second opinions -- two, three, four times over -- at the click of your mouse.

And if we see something we think a friend would find fabulous, Copious lets us put them in the know.

Invite friends at #{rewrite_mailer_url dashboard_url(more_invites: 1)}

Happy selling,] %>
